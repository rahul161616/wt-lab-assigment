	<h1>Earth</h1>
	<p>Earth is the planet we live on. It is one of the planets where we can find life. It is a unique planet where water resource is found on the surface. Around 73% of the surface of the earth is covered with water.</p>
</br>
   <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. While large amounts of water can be found throughout the Solar System, only Earth sustains liquid surface water. <b>About 71% of Earth's surface is made up of the ocean, dwarfing Earth's polar ice, lakes, and rivers.</b><u>(Demonstration of bold tag)</u>The remaining 29% of Earth's surface is land, consisting of continents and islands. Earth's surface layer is formed of several slowly moving tectonic plates, interacting to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes, and earthquakes. Earth's liquid outer core generates the magnetic field that shapes Earth's magnetosphere, deflecting destructive solar winds.

Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More solar energy is received by tropical regions than polar regions and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere and forms clouds that cover most of the planet. Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere like carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub><u>(Demonstration of subscript))</u> trap a part of the energy from the Sun close to the surface. A region's climate is governed by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to moderating oceans. Severe weather, such as tropical cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and greatly impacts life.</br></br>
<i><b>Earth is an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System.</i></b><u>(Demonstration of Italic tag)</u>Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around its own axis in just less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons. Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, <small>which orbits Earth at 380,000 km (1.3 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth.</small><u>(Demonstration of small tag)</u> The Moon always faces the Earth with the same side through tidal locking and causes tides, stabilizes Earth's axis, and gradually slows its rotation.
<strong>The speed of light is 3X10<sup>8</sup>m/s</p></strong> <u>(Demonstration of strong and superscript tag)</u></br></br>
<p><em>The due date for this work is</em><mark>7/22/2022</mark><u> (Demonstration of mark tag)</u></p>
